### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wasn't really paying much attention that much to some parts of css like this "mix-blend-mode" property which does a super cool effect to the image and with the code below the effect gets triggered when the image is in hover state.

Here's the CSS code snippet, see below:

```css
.image-area img:hover
{
    mix-blend-mode: difference;
}
```
